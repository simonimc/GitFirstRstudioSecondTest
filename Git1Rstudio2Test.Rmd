Work on placing an rmd file into your new git repostiory

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#install.packages('usethis')
library(usethis)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

Make a table and plot
```{r}
x<- seq(1, 10, 1)
y<- seq(1, 50, 5)

df<- as.data.frame(cbind(x, y))

plot(df$x, df$y)
```

Commit and push to git
```{r}
#save rmd
#check it in the git panel under 'staged'
#hit commit 
#make a comment and mark the date and time
#hit commit
#hit push
#Check your repo online
```

Try adding your data to the new project
```{r}
#place a .csv file in the project file in your windows explorer (or mac equivilent)
#read in table
sample<- read.csv('test_data.csv')

#try an analyses
summary(lm(Count ~ Year*Site, data = sample))

#try a plot
ggplot(data = sample, aes(x = Site, y = Count, color = Year)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Site, y = Count, color = Year), position = 'jitter') +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Site, y = Count), alpha = 0.5)
```

Commit and push csv and changes to the rmd
```{r}
#try on your own using steps from previous "commit and push" chunk
```
